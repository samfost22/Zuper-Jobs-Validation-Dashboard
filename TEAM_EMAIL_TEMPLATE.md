**Subject:** Zuper-NetSuite Monitoring Dashboard Now Live

---

Hi Team,

I've built a monitoring dashboard to help us track Zuper organizations and their NetSuite ID coverage in real-time.

## Access the Dashboard

**URL:** http://192.168.1.184:5001

*(Must be connected to the office WiFi/network)*

## What It Does

The dashboard helps us:
- ✅ Monitor all 188 active organizations
- ✅ Track which organizations have NetSuite Customer IDs (currently 94.7% coverage)
- ⚠️ Get alerts for organizations missing NetSuite IDs (10 currently need attention)
- 📊 See newly created organizations (filter by last 7 or 30 days)
- 📥 Export data to CSV for reporting

## Current Stats

- **Total Organizations:** 188 active
- **With NetSuite ID:** 178 (94.7% coverage)
- **Missing NetSuite ID:** 10 organizations need attention
- **Open Alerts:** 10 unresolved
- **New This Week:** 1 organization
- **New This Month:** 3 organizations

## How to Use It

### Daily Monitoring
1. Open the dashboard at the start of your day
2. Check the "Missing NetSuite ID" filter to see which organizations need attention
3. Review any new alerts

### Finding New Organizations
- Use the "New (7 days)" filter to see recently created organizations
- This helps catch new customers that might be missing NetSuite IDs

### Exporting Reports
- Click "Export CSV" to download current data
- Great for weekly/monthly status reports

### Alerts
- The dashboard automatically creates alerts for organizations without NetSuite IDs
- Click "Resolve" once you've added the NetSuite ID in Zuper

## Three Main Tabs

1. **Organizations** - View and filter all organizations
2. **Alerts** - See which organizations need NetSuite IDs added
3. **Sync History** - Track when data was last updated from Zuper

## Features

- 🔄 Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- 🔍 Search by organization name or email
- 📊 Filter by status, creation date, or NetSuite ID presence
- 📥 Export to CSV with one click
- 📱 Works on mobile and desktop

## Data Freshness

The dashboard syncs with Zuper API regularly. If you need the latest data immediately, let me know and I can run a manual sync.

## Organizations Currently Missing NetSuite IDs

These 10 organizations need attention:

1. Landgut Nemt
2. Rhone Bio
3. Koetsenruijter
4. Boettcher Gartenbau
5. Henrich Vinnen GbR
6. Schäfer / Meyer GmbH
7. Cuma Casdi
8. Ellenholm & Vadensjö Jordbruks Ab
9. DanRoots A/S
10. Ecotractor del sur
